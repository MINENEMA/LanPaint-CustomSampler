# LanPaint (Thinking mode Inpaint)

Unlock precise inpainting without additional training. LanPaint lets the model "think" through multiple iterations before denoising, aiming for seamless and accurate results. 

## Features

- üé® **Zero-Training Inpainting** - Works immediately with ANY SD model, even custom models you've trained yourself
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple Integration** - Same workflow as standard ComfyUI KSampler
- üöÄ **Quality Enhancements** - High quality and seamless inpainting

## Example Results
All examples use random seed 0 to ensure fair comparison.

**How to Use These Examples:**  
1. Navigate to the **example** folder (i.e example_1) by clicking **View Workflow & Masks**, download all pictures.  
2. Drag **InPainted_Drag_Me_to_ComfyUI.png** into ComfyUI to load the workflow.  
3. Download the required model from Civitai by clicking **Model Used in This Example**.  
4. Load the model into the **"Load Checkpoint"** node.  
5. Upload **Original_No_Mask.png** to the **"Load image"** node in the **"Original Image"** group (far left).  
6. Upload **Masked_Load_Me_in_Loader.png** to the **"Load image"** node in the **"Mask image for inpainting"** group (second from left).  
7. Queue the task, you will get inpainted results from three methods:  
   - **[VAE Encode for Inpainting](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/inpaint/)** (middle),  
   - **[Set Latent Noise Mask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/tutorial/basic/how-to-inpaint-an-image-in-comfyui)** (second from right),  
   - **LanPaint** (far right).  

Compare and explore the results from each method!

## Quickstart

1. **Install ComfyUI**: Follow the official [ComfyUI installation guide](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started) to set up ComfyUI on your system.  
2. **Install ComfyUI-Manager**: Add the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) for easy extension management.  
3. **Install LanPaint Nodes**:  
   - **Via ComfyUI-Manager**: Search for "[LanPaint](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/scraed/nodes/LanPaint)" in the manager and install it directly.  
   - **Manually**: Click "Install via Git URL" in ComfyUI-Manager and input the GitHub repository link:  
     ```
     https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint.git
     ```  
     Alternatively, clone this repository into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.  
4. **Restart ComfyUI**: Restart ComfyUI to load the LanPaint nodes.  

Once installed, you'll find the LanPaint nodes under the "sampling" category in ComfyUI. Use them just like the default KSampler for high-quality inpainting!

## Usage

**Workflow Setup**  
Same as default ComfyUI KSampler - simply replace with LanPaint KSampler nodes. The inpainting workflow is the same as the [SetLatentNoiseMask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/zh/comfyui-nodes/latent/inpaint/set-latent-noise-mask) inpainting workflow.

**Note**
- LanPaint requires binary masks (values of 0 or 1) without opacity or smoothing. To ensure compatibility, set the mask's **opacity and hardness to maximum** in your mask editor. During inpainting, any mask with smoothing or gradients will automatically be converted to a binary mask.
- LanPaint relies heavily on your text prompts to guide inpainting - explicitly describe the content you want generated in the masked area. If results show artifacts or mismatched elements, counteract them with targeted negative prompts.

### Basic Sampler
![Samplers](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/Nodes.JPG)  
**LanPaint KSampler**  
Simplified interface with recommended defaults:

- Steps: 50+ recommended
- LanPaint NumSteps: 1-10 (complexity of edits)
- Built-in parameter presets

**LanPaint KSampler (Advanced)**  
Full parameter control:
## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `Steps` | 0-100 | Total steps of diffusion sampling. Higher means better inpainting. Recommend 50. |
| `LanPaint_NumSteps` | 0-20 | Reasoning iterations per denoising step ("thinking depth"). Easy task: 1-2. Hard task: 5-10 |
| `LanPaint_Lambda` | 0.1-50 | Content alignment strength (higher = stricter). Recommend 6.0 |
| `LanPaint_StepSize` | 0.1-1.0 | The StepSize of each thinking step. Recommend 0.1 for most cases, 0.5 for some difficult cases. |
| `LanPaint_cfg_BIG` | 0-20 | CFG scale used when aligning masked and unmasked region (higher = better alignment). Recommend 8 for seamless inpaint (i.e limbs, faces), 0-1 for character consistency (i.e multiple view) |

For detailed descriptions of each parameter, simply hover your mouse over the corresponding input field to view tooltips with additional information.



## LanPaint KSampler (Advanced) Tuning Guide
For challenging inpainting tasks:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Primary Adjustments**:
- Increase **steps**, **LanPaint_StepSize**Ôºå**LanPaint_NumSteps** (thinking iterations), and **LanPaint_cfg_BIG** (guidance scale).
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Secondary Tweaks**:  
- Boost **LanPaint_Lambda** (spatial constraint strength) or **LanPaint_StepSize** (denoising aggressiveness).
    
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Balance Speed vs Stability**:  
- Reduce **LanPaint_Friction** to prioritize faster results with fewer "thinking" steps (*may risk instability*).  
- Increase **LanPaint_Tamed** (noise normalization onto a sphere) or **LanPaint_Alpha** (constraint the friction of underdamped Langevin dynamics) to suppress artifacts.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**:  
- Optimal parameters vary depending on the **model** and the **size of the inpainting area**.  
- For effective tuning, **fix the seed** and adjust parameters incrementally while observing the results. This helps isolate the impact of each setting.
